## Chapter 1 Project Overview
The event is that Dig Data cooperated with BT Group to provide an opportunity to experience the "real world" business problem.

### Background Information
BT group is investigating why some customers stop using BT services (churn), including:
- Build a model that predicts which customers are highly likely to leave 
- Interpret the model to understand what influences the customers' decision to leave
- Make recommendations to the business:
  - How to engage the customers to stay with BT?
  - How to retain more customers?

## Chapter 2 Data Validation
BT provided 7,043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The "Churn" columns is the target, showing whether the customer left the company (Churn = 'Yes') or not (Churn = 'No').

The dataset includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month - the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for - phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information - how long they've been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers - gender, if they have partners and dependents
